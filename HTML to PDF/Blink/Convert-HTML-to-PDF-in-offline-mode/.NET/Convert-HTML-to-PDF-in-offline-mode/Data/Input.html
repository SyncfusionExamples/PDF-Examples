  <h1>Understanding the PDF Document Format</h1>
  <section>
    <p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe in the early 1990s to present documents consistently across different devices and platforms. It encapsulates text, fonts, images, and graphics in a single file, preserving the layout and formatting regardless of the software or hardware used to view it.</p>

  <h2>Advantages</h2>
